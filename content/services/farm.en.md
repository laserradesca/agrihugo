From kids to adults, we believe it’s important to stay curious about our surroundings: think about them in creative new ways, have the courage to challenge held opinions, and experiment with what at first may seem strange and difficult. 

Our workshops and courses focus on the farming techniques and cultural roots of all our produce, the local wild environment, and agriculture in Bergamo and the world both historically and today. We offer:
- full-day and half-day educational visits with a range of workshops for preschools, primary schools and social groups;
- hands-on farming and recreational experiences for private companies and high schools;
- multi-visit workshop series;
- holiday camps for children 5-11 years

### English learning
Our full educational program is also offered in English language immersion versions, planned and run by Lauren, owner farmer of Cascina La Cà, and native English speaker from Australia, specialised in English language teaching for children 3-12 years, and business English for adults. 

Our English language courses are designed especially for Italian native speakers, with a focus on *Content and Language Integrated Learning* ([CLIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_immersion "Wikipedia")) methodology, whereby language learning objectives are achieved by participants actively practising targeted English skills while learning the lesson content. This method not only encourages language skill retention through experiential learning, but also creates the opportunity for students to improvise and be creative in situations outside their comfort zone.
