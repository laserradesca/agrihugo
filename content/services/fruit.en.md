We grow what we love, and what works in our local conditions: species and varieties are inspired locally and from our travels around the world. 

All of our fresh produce is grown to be hand-picked in the field by us, or directly by you to take home and enjoy: fruit, veg and berries, nuts, aromatic herbs and edible, decorative plants.

### Our farming philosophy
While we do adopt many organic farming methods, our research and experience has led us to decide against organic certification because we believe that integrating certain conventional farming practices improves the sustainability of our farm, both for the environment, and for us, our neighbours and our customers. We also believe in transparency and informed choice, so are always happy to explain every process and product used in growing all of our food, and the reasoning behind every choice. This is the benefit of buying locally, and having direct contact with those who grow your food.
