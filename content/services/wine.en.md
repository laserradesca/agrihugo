We produce three grape varieties particular to the Bergamo region.

Our *Moscato Giallo* grape is an historical variety for Bergamo winegrowers. This grape is usually cultivated to produce dessert (passito) wine, but we have chosen a classic, dry winemaking method, obtaining an excellent before-dinner wine. Our *Moscato Giallo* has an intense, tropical perfume coupled with a light, mineral flavour. Serve at 10-12°C. 11.5% Alc. by vol.

-----

Our *Incrocio Manzoni 6.0.13* grape was created in the 1930s by agronomist Luigi Manzoni (1888-1968), cross-breeding Riesling Renano with Pinot Bianco. This white wine is well-structured with a subtle, tart finish, and goes perfectly with soups, rice dishes, fish and white meat. Serve at 10-12°C. 14% Alc. by vol.

-----

Our *Incrocio Terzi N.1* grape is one of the very few varieties native to Bergamo, and is only just now being rediscovered and newly appreciated after many years of being almost completely forgotten. It was created by Riccardo Terzi (†1963) in his vineyards in Sotto il Monte Giovanni XXIII, a suburb of Bergamo. *Incrocio Terzi N.1* is a cross-breed of the grape varieties Barbera and Cabernet Franc, toning down the acidity of Barbera with the softness of Cabernet Franc to produce a red wine that is earthy, tannic with hints of vanilla, and adapts well to a range of foods, especially cured meat and cheese platters, pasta, and simple dishes based on white or red meat. Serve at 14-16°C. 12% Alc. by vol.
