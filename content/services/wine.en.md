We produce three grape varieties particular to the Bergamo region for the production of Bergamasca IGT classified wine. IGT stands for Indicazione Geografica Tipica, and you can read more about what that means [here](https://www.flavoursholidays.co.uk/blog/italian-wine-classifications-doc-docg-igt-vdt/).

Our Moscato Giallo grape is an historical variety for Bergamo winegrowers. This grape is usually cultivated to produce muscat or dessert (passito) wine, but we have chosen a classic, dry winemaking method, obtaining an excellent appetiser, or aperitivo, wine. Our Moscato Giallo has an intense, tropical perfume coupled with a light, mineral and balanced flavour. 

Our Incrocio Manzoni 6.0.13 grape was created in the 1930s by agronomist Luigi Manzoni (1888-1968), cross-breeding Riesling Renano with Pinot Bianco. This white wine is well-structured with a subtle, tart finish, and goes perfectly with soups, rice dishes, fish and white meat.

Our Incrocio Terzi N.1 grape is one of the very few varieties native to Bergamo, and is only just now being rediscovered and newly appreciated after many years of being almost completely forgotten. It was created by Riccardo Terzi (â€ 1963) in his vineyards in Sotto il Monte Giovanni XXIII, a suburb of Bergamo. Incrocio Terzi N.1 is a cross-breed of the grape varieties Barbera and Cabernet Franc, toning down the acidity of Barbera with the softness of Cabernet Franc to produce a red wine that is vinous, tannic with hints of vanilla, and adapts well to a range of foods, especially cured meat and cheese platters, pasta, and simple dishes based on white or red meat. Find out more about this interesting grape variety here. (can we have a single blog post page only accessible through this link??)
