        Cascina La CÃ  is a place for curious people to enjoy authentic farm produce and experience first-hand how it is grown, harvested and prepared. Our workshops, courses and events are run in both English and Italian languages, and focus on the local environment in a global context, encouraging a deeper understanding of how our world works, and inspiring the courage to think differently and act more thoughtfully.
