    post: "Lauren was born and raised on the east coast of Australia. She moved to Bergamo in 2012 with Paolo after some stints living in Denmark, the UK, and in Sweden where she completed a Masters degree in Sustainable Development. From managing the crops and the bee yard, to the admin, sales and educational programs, Lauren has her hands on every part of the farm, but doesnâ€™t do it all alone."
